## What is it?

This repository was used to conceive and implement _rcrypt_ encryption+hashing algorithm.<br/>
_rcrypt_ was made to encrypt/hash information(specifically passwords) with pretty bad performance.<br/>

It is also a part of [_RedLibrary_](https://github.com/Red-company/RedLibrary).

## What about speed?

It's about _1088.5x - 2350.7x_ speed down, comparing to [_Sha256_](https://github.com/vladimirrogozin/Sha256) algorithm.

* [_Sha256 speed test_](https://github.com/Red-Laboratory/exp1_sha256-speedtest)
* [_rcrypt speed test_](https://github.com/Red-Laboratory/exp2_rcrypt-speedtest)
